    <p>
      This interview with <a href="">Magdalena Moskalewicz</a> and{" "}
      <a href="">Daniel Muzyczuk</a> discusses the Polish Radio Experimental
      Studio, otherwise known as PRES. In her introduction to the Studio,
      Moskalewicz positions PRES as “a site—understood equally as institution,
      physical space, and a circle of individuals.” This exchange departs from
      this multidimensional approach to PRES, while emphasizing Moskalewicz’s
      and Muzyczuk’s work—as curators, art historians, and researchers— along
      with the Studio’s history and legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRES was the first center for electronic music east of the Iron
      Curtain—and the seventh studio of its kind in the world—established to
      explore, produce, and disseminate new sonic possibilities. Founded in
      1957, the Studio continued to operate until 2004. Though its inception was
      predicated on producing requisite{" "}
      <a href="">Warsaw Autumn International Festival</a> of Contemporary Music
      music for state radio broadcasts and film soundtracks, the Studio also
      made autonomous electronic pieces and independent compositions. While its
      most widely known outputs were undoubtedly film scores, The , which
      continues to operate to this day, was a key way in which PRES’s
      independent material reached the public. The Studio was spearheaded by
      <a href="">Józef Patkowski</a>, with Krzysztof Szlifirski, Wojciech
      Makowski, Anna Skrzyńska, <a href="">Eugeniusz Rudnik</a>, and Bohdan
      Mazurek forming the original team. Later, the Studio would also draw in
      Grażyna Karaśkiewicz, Barbara Okoń-Makowska, Ewa Guziołek-Tubelewicz,
      Tadeusz Sudnik, and Ryszard Szeremeta. It constituted a crucial center,
      attracting both local and international composers to work with its
      equipment and sound engineers. Some of these artists were{" "}
      <a href="">Włodzimierz Kotoński</a>, <a href="">Andrzej Dobrowolski</a>,{" "}
      <a href="">Krzysztof Penderecki</a>, <a href="">Bogusław Schaeffer</a>,
      Elżbieta Sikora, Tomasz Sikorski, Krzysztof Knittel, Arne Nordheim,
      Dubravko Detoni, Franco Evangelisti, Roland Kayn, and Teresa Rampazzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRES operated out of what was known as the “Black Room.” A 6 x 6 meter
      studio was designed by the renowned Polish architects Oskar and Zofia
      Hansen. Tightly fitted with modular elements, innovative equipment,
      rotating frames, and movable panels, the room was both an audio tool and
      an audiovisual device. It was designed according to Oskar Hansen’s{" "}
      <a href="">Open Form theory</a>, which dictates that architectural space
      should be adaptable to its users. Crucially, the Black Room was located in
      the state-owned Polish Radio building in Warsaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 50-odd years of the Studio’s operation, the sociopolitical
      climate in Poland went through critical shifts. On the one hand, for much
      of PRES’s history, Poland was still the Polish People’s Republic
      (PRL)—operating under Soviet influence, part of the Eastern Bloc, and
      ideologically separated from the West. On the other hand, PRES was formed
      at the very beginning of the Thaw which fortified civil rights and
      artistic freedom. The 60s and early 70s that followed are often understood
      as a particularly active period in Polish culture. In 1989 Poland
      transitioned from a communist to democratic state and in 2004 it joined
      the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the Studio’s closure that same year, there has been a newfound wave
      of interest in their production. Notably, the products of this enthusiasm
      include: post, MoMA’s digital research platform with a dedicated section
      on PRES (with an extended list of sources here); Sounding the Body
      Electric: Experiments in Art and Music in Eastern Europe 1957–1984, an
      exhibition held at Muzeum Sztuki in in 2012 and in Calvert 22 in London in
      2013, plus the accompanying catalogue; that released an anthological
      series of PRES music; Through the Soundproof Curtain, an exhibition held
      at ZKM | Karlsruhe in 2018; and subsequently Ultra Sounds: The Sonic Art
      of Polish Radio Experimental Studio, a book released by ZKM | Karlsruhe in
      2019. It is hoped that this interview will make a small contribution to
      this rich web of PRES resources.
    </p>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      What, to you, was PRES? Or rather, what of PRES are you most determined to
      research, preserve, or extend? Magdalena’s introduction notes that it can
      be “understood equally as institution, physical space, and a circle of
      individuals,” so I am curious which facet of the Studio takes precedence
      for you and your work.
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="Magdalena Moskalewicz (MM)">
      To me, PRES is fascinating specifically because it was all these three
      things simultaneously. Its institutional status cannot be fully detached
      from its physical location, complete with its design, and that location
      only makes sense as a place of use, a place of human interaction. Working
      on PRES made me realize that looking at history through the lens of the
      sites of artistic production—as opposed to, say, artists or
      artworks—grants to a historian an unparalleled perspective. While focusing
      on individual makers always carries with it a threat of the artist-genius
      rhetoric and looking at artworks alone may erase the social and political
      context from the horizon, sites—the places where art is made and
      circulated—are at the crossroads of individual agencies, spatial and
      aesthetic circumstances, material conditions, and socio-political
      dynamics.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="Daniel Muzyczuk (DM)">
      For me, it is the methodology of working with tape that allows me to think
      of other audiovisual reconfigurations in the art field as the structural
      outcomes of technological inventions. The materialization of sound in the
      form of tape strips is also something that opened doors for scientific
      research. This is the reason why spaces like PRES are always created in
      between the experimental laboratory and the artist’s studio. That factor
      also opened doors to the idea of concrete sounds as a reservoir that can
      be reshaped into universal language. The ambitions of these projects were
      really spectacular. However, most of the work is known simply through
      their finished pieces of music, which are listened to for aesthetic
      pleasure and contemplation. So, there is always this inconsistency between
      the horizon of intentions and where the actual, pragmatic work ends.
      However, the sounds ended up influencing people's lives and their ears in
      a totally different setting—the cinema and pop culture. Even if it is
      characteristic of most of the work of avant-gardes, I find this collision
      inspiring. The revolution was incited, but simply not in the area where it
      was intended.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      How did you come to work on PRES? What sparked your individual interests?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      Three things came into play that led me to PRES. At the time, in 2012, I
      was working at The Museum of Modern Art conducting research into the
      Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, Łódź Bôłt Records, a record
      label Karlsruhe in 2019. It is hoped this interview will make a small
      contribution to this rich web of PRES ZKM | Karlsruhe in 2018; and
      subsequently ZKM | resources. and specifically focusing on Fluxus
      connections in Eastern Europe. I was also one of the founding editors of
      post, MoMA’s digital publication about to launch in early 2013, and
      together with my colleagues I was planning initial content on modern art
      from Latin America, East Asia, and Eastern Europe—it was my job to
      envision a subject for the latter. The first thing was that I had just
      completed a PhD that looked at experimental art in Poland between roughly
      1955 and 1970, and so that was my main expertise. The second, that the
      Polish connection of George Maciunas in that early moment of Fluxus was
      Józef Patkowski—the two had met long before PRES or Fluxus ever
      existed—which led my research from visual arts into the milieu of
      experimental music. The third was that other content planned for post was
      thematizing Sogetsu Art Center, a major hub for experimental music in
      Tokyo, which meant that the editorial team gave a lot of thought to the
      idea of site as a conveyor for artistic practice. These three elements:
      Fluxus, Poland, and focus on sites of artistic production came together to
      bring to my attention the Polish Radio Experimental Studio as the perfect
      case study.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      There were two decisive moments when it comes to tracing the recent
      research on the Studio work. The initial impulse came from two curators
      involved with the music scene: Michał Mendyk and Michał Libera, who
      started uncovering the archives of PRES in an unorthodox manner. Since
      access to the musical material made at the institute was restricted, they
      used publicly available scores to reformulate the questions posed by music
      on tape. Through their projects they were trying to reimagine the music
      through commissioning new interpretations of these materials. The scores
      that were intended to be used as a source for consultation—and were
      sometimes even created only after the piece of music was completed—started
      to be treated as an invitation to be shaped anew. This reconstructive look
      toward the future was truly inspiring. Later Mendyk started a whole series
      of anthologies at Bôłt Records, dedicated to uncovering different aspects
      of music produced at PRES. This should be seen as a logical consequence of
      the initial unorthodox and creative moment. The other trigger was the fact
      that David Crowley had an idea to organize an exhibition [Sounding the
      Body Electric: Experiments in Art and Music in Eastern Europe 1957– 1984]
      around the theme of the intersection of art and new music in socialist
      countries after 1956. He approached Muzeum Sztuki and I joined him in this
      journey. The research was focused on the involvement of PRES with cinema
      and visual arts, so it formed a natural alliance with Bôłt Records. The
      research was used for two iterations of the exhibition, which took place
      at Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź in 2012 and Calvert 22 in London in 2013. On a
      more personal level, as a curator interested in the influence of new
      technologies on art of the 60s and 70s, PRES is a natural treasure trove.
      It entered socialist pop culture through cinema, so even if you had never
      heard of the composers that were working there, you would probably have
      known their music. But this just scratches the surface of a lot of
      cutting-edge research and projects.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      I am interested in the myriad of ways you have approached the subject. In
      your work on PRES, you have dealt with original audio, video recordings,
      score reprints, and documentary photographs through a digital publishing
      platform, as well as books, interviews, commissioned essays, exhibitions,
      and an ongoing bibliography. What has your experience been with making
      these available through such a wide range of platforms?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      Working as an editor of a digital publication alongside art curators, who
      have at their disposal magnificent physical galleries, while you only have
      the vastness of the immaterial online space, you think about projects that
      would complement other museum programing rather than trying to compete
      with it. Sound pieces are actually very challenging to feature in a
      gallery space, as are multipage rare books (in this case: sheet music).
      Post provided the perfect space to spotlight the multifaceted character of
      the Experimental Studio while PRES turned out to be the ideal subject to
      highlight the full functionality of the platform. On the combination of
      formats—essays, interviews, archival materials, multimedia—this variety is
      a feature of the platform in general, as it had been conceived as a hybrid
      between an online magazine, a digital archive, and a project space.
      Looking at PRES as a site—rather than a group of people—allowed us to
      include a variety of materials without imposing an artistic hierarchy. I
      have seen people calling the PRES material on post an “online exhibition,”
      and I guess that is not incorrect, though I do think that doesn’t account
      for the hybridity of the format.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      And what about bringing PRES specifically into an art context?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      Works of art are naturally the primary material for an exhibition. By this
      I mean pieces that were originally intended to be presented in a gallery
      or a museum, sometimes even made by a visual artist. Closer to the gallery
      world are film stills, even if they were originally circulated in the
      cinema context. Of course, the interest of a curator representing a
      specific institutional context changes the classification of a particular
      object. Graphic scores are in this group. Even if some of the authors were
      connected with the gallery world, like Bogusław Schaeffer, others were
      producing these forms of notation as a method of mediation between
      composer and performer (or, in the case of the sound engineer, music on
      tape). However, the visual qualities of these scores, which appeal
      directly to those familiar with the whole tradition of conceptual art,
      change their status into an object of aesthetic contemplation. We also
      needed to consider reconstructions of key intermedia works that were not
      preserved or well documented. The methodology offered by the graphic score
      proved to be adequate. Hence, for the Sounding the Body Electric show, we
      were able to document a new performance of a piece written by a visual
      artist Krzysztof Wodiczko and composer Szabolcs Esztényi. The same
      principle was used to build the reconstruction of the first sound
      installation in Poland—Spatial-Musical Composition by Zygmunt Krauze,
      Teresa Kelm, and Henryk Morel in 1968. The work of this team—consisting of
      a composer, an architect, and a sculptor—was also treated as if it was a
      score, which allowed us to construct another performance.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      In an effort to build on the history of PRES, where do you position
      musical (re)interpretations? For example, I am thinking here about the
      establishment of the PRES sound library in 2018 and the subsequent music
      competition in 2019, which asked participants to use samples from the
      library to create new compositions. Is this what it means to extend the
      history of PRES? To continue its ethos of recycling sound? To make its
      sound contemporary?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      This is a direct continuation of the efforts of Mendyk that I mentioned
      earlier. Both Libera and Mendyk saw their curatorial work with the PRES
      archives not only as archival, but also as intermediary—those that create
      the context for past works to feel relevant. There is one more level to
      this activity. Unlike GRM in Paris or EMS in Stockholm, PRES was closed.
      These other studios still welcome composers, who are allowed to use their
      equipment and archives. The works from the 60s have a natural continuation
      in the pieces by younger generations. The opening of the sound library is
      an attempt at a similar effect—it is not simply about the culture of
      remix, but more about the continuity.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      What did it mean for PRES to be situated within the building of the Polish
      Radio, a national entity that continues to operate under governmental
      rule?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      PRES was not only situated in a state-owned building as a part of a state
      institution. It could only exist and function specifically because it was
      funded and protected by the state. It is one of the paradoxes that is
      difficult to understand particularly from the US American perspective,
      where state funding for culture is automatically equated with state
      censorship and control. The realities of the Polish People's Republic,
      with its cultural politics and administration, were rather complex. In
      this case, it was enough to receive the support of one influential
      individual, Włodzimierz Sokorski, who was the Minister of Culture and Art
      between 1952 and 1956, to automatically get a free hand in
      experimentation.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      The spatial arrangement of the studio and its location were of course due
      to the state of technology. Naturally, with the cheaper production of
      instruments and tools, access became more democratic. Also, this
      location's proximity to power was not a coincidence. There was a very
      curious mixture of elements that resulted in the operations of PRES. A
      politically charged location where composers and artists were working
      strictly on invitation from the Studio itself. The tools were available,
      but only for a limited number of people belonging to the club. The
      atmosphere was built on the elitist character of new music, as well as a
      bit of hermetism founded on the fact that the specific tools and methods
      were rather hard to understand. The state also needed that element in
      order to appear progressive.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      Following from this, Daniel, I wanted to open the next question with a
      reference to an incredible segment from an interview you did with
      Eugeniusz Rudnik, where he said:
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      Did the creation of art ennoble that empty shell of a state? Should I be
      proud of that? Or should I be ashamed that I legitimized it to the world,
      with my own hands, as the producer of these works? To the first question,
      I answer, “Yes, of course.” . . . [It] meant that Poland was alive. . . .
      Was it worth making art? Yes, it was worth it, and it was needed.
      Fortunately, we created works that lasted, that successfully function
      today in the free world, in free Poland.
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      Especially from today’s perspective, there seems to be contradictions
      about living and working under communism. Could you speak to the political
      climate of Poland during PRES’s epoch and how it shaped the Studio’s
      possibilities?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      The Studio was an instrument that allowed the authorities to present the
      Polish People's Republic as a progressive state. PRES was well known in
      the new music world and there was some public exposure through its role in
      the creation of film soundtracks. But it was mostly recognized as a space
      for autonomous experimentation. In that sense it was politically safe, as
      this kind of music did not have to be heavily controlled because it never
      had any direct political message (except for times when it was used for
      direct propaganda). However, when you look closely at individual works,
      some of them do stand out as political statements.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer>
      Agnieszka Pindera recently published a biography of Patkowski—the first
      director of PRES. It gives a good idea of the politics of new music and
      the role of the employees of Polish Radio. Patkowski, as the head of the
      Polish Composers’ Union, decided that during martial law the Warsaw Autumn
      Festival would not take place. This was probably one of the decisions that
      led to him losing his position at the Studio. PRES took part in the
      discussions on the passive role of the viewer/listener of new music and on
      the process of emancipation of the performer. This was not only seen in
      music. A similar movement of visual artists connected with the GRAV
      collective was associated with the restructuring of public space and
      politics around May 1968. Thus, all the projects connected with the
      emancipation of listener and performer should be seen in a political
      horizon—even if, for the authorities, they were solely reserved for
      internal discussions. Then there was a group of works that were also
      posing more direct political questions. This includes the works of
      Krzysztof Wodiczko, an industrial designer who entered the field of
      audiovisual art with questions on autonomy of art and its efficiency in
      real life. His Personal Instrument is exactly the kind of project that
      allows us to see how sound can be political. He created a set of gloves
      with photo sensors and microphones that controlled the sounds delivered to
      the user via headset. So the piece allowed one to control the sonosphere
      of a strictly controlled public sphere. Some of Krzysztof Knittel’s
      compositions from the 70s also touch on the possibility of creating
      spheres of autonomy for the artist, along with the social and political
      limits of these spaces. Finally, there was a group that was directly and
      socially involved. For the Scandinavian Pavilion at the Expo in Osaka in
      1970, Arne Nordheim, with assistance from Rudnik, created a piece that
      used a live mix of audio recordings indicating ecological struggles. Art
      was used to direct the gaze of the listener towards these issues.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      With that question, you are pointing to one of the biggest dilemmas that
      art historians of the period are dealing with today. Is the official art
      made between 1945 and 1989 automatically Communist? Should art that
      originated as a state commission be dismissed en masse? Or should its
      aesthetic form and/or its later functioning be allowed to define its
      ultimate value on a case by case basis? The one way that I can answer this
      question very concisely is to say that I don’t believe that “freedom” and
      “lack of freedom/dependence” are categories that are helpful in
      understanding art produced under Communism. These are the
      categories—together with “original/derivative”—that have been often used
      by academics in relation to this material, but I find them rather
      limiting.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      I wanted to mention a project called Cities and Memory, which is a
      crowdsourced site for pooling together field recordings from across the
      world. Recently, it has charted how our aural lives are changing under the
      pandemic lockdown—it brings together the sound of a near-silent Times
      Square, the clatter of the NHS clap in London, the first time a man living
      in central Warsaw can hear birdsong. This made me think of how PRES
      focused on sonically “rediscovering the mundane”—concrete noises,
      discarded sounds, etc. Do you think the PRES sound library gives us
      something temporally and geographically specific?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      There is a set of common denominators in early electroacoustic and
      electronic music that make it into the universal language that Pierre
      Schaeffer was after. But of course, there are personal traits in the work
      of individual composers. What makes PRES special is that there were
      engineers on permanent contracts that were working with composers to
      realize their ideas. And since some of them, like Rudnik or Bohdan
      Mazurek, were also composers themselves, it led to working with a certain
      set of sounds or ways of doing things. You can sometimes hear the same
      sounds used by Rudnik in his own work and in the work of Nordheim. But
      there is also another community of sounds: a shared library. Some of the
      sound objects were shared between different users. This was the case with
      the collection of percussion sounds that was commissioned by Michael
      Ranta. The engineers were also exchanging sounds with each other. One also
      needs to add another factor to the equation—the fact that everyone is
      looking for innovation. Hence, as always with modern art, we have this
      delicate balance between familiarity and novelty.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      The Studio has been described as “an island of international connection.”
      Especially in its earlier years, this was a central part of its
      significance and success—the ability to host and collaborate with
      composers from abroad. When you were charting the history of the Studio,
      how much of the narrative felt distinctly local and how much felt
      principally international?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      The Studio drew attention to itself from the start, as many Western
      composers were looking for opportunities to work behind the Iron Curtain.
      Some were politically oriented towards the left, others merely curious.
      The Studio became a meeting hub, just like the Warsaw Autumn Festival. The
      state was also investing in infrastructure and promotion in those early
      years. In the late 60s PRES was also accepting Fulbright scholars. As the
      years passed, the state radio became less interested in preserving
      international connections.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      How important was PRES as a physical and shared space? And would it be any
      different if it were still operating today? I am thinking about how
      digital and cyber technologies were a significant factor in the downfall
      of the Studio and wondering if you would argue that cyberspace or bedroom
      studios could become the sole site for creating and fostering artistic
      experimentation, or if it remains important to maintain physical, shared
      spaces. In the context of PRES, this applies to music production
      specifically, but it remains a relevant—and, indeed, timely—question for
      all cultural practices.
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      Bedroom studios have my full support, especially under the current
      circumstances of a global lockdown. But there is something to be said
      about the power of a shared space—not just a physical room, but also a
      legal entity with all the institutional implications (the good and the
      bad); a more conceptual, imagined nod that creates a sense of belonging
      and allows for creative solidarity, not to mention fostering intellectual
      and artistic exchanges. The digital space gave birth to unprecedented new
      models of art making. But it cannot serve as a full replacement for being
      together, as I think we are all becoming painfully aware right now . . .

    <InterviewQuestion>
      What about the Black Room, PRES’s studio space designed by the famous
      Polish architects, Oskar and Zofia Hansen? Józef Patkowski’s dedication to
      creating a special space for electronic music has been described as an
      “unheard-of phenomenon,” lauded for looking to pair function with
      impressive architectural design. Since then, it’s been heavily
      mythologized, described as “an instrument” and “sound laboratory.” In
      reality, how much of that was the space itself? Has it been lost forever?
      Does it matter? I’ve read that Warsaw’s Museum of Modern Art had the
      intention of rebuilding it, but I haven’t been able to confirm what’s
      happened since.
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      The Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw has indeed announced that the new
      building of the institution, which is currently being erected, will
      feature a reconstruction of the Black Room’s interior. The museum was
      involved with the estate of Oskar Hansen, so it’s a logical move. However,
      the interior was highly criticized by Rudnik for a number of reasons. The
      blinds that were meant to allow the composer to change the sonic qualities
      of the room were really hard to move. Moreover, their presence was due to
      the fact that initially the studio was also meant to be a space for
      microphone recordings. However, they were usually done elsewhere, so
      nobody really needed more reflective or more absorbing surfaces. The other
      problem was the miniaturization of equipment that soon led to it not
      fitting into the custom equipment racks. This is connected with the main
      problem—that the studio was simply too small and that one needs space in
      order to have infrastructure that is flexible and can be adjusted to the
      needs of the user.

    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      Hansen’s was a cutting-edge functionalist design that did not exactly
      serve its function. Not an unseen situation in the history of modernism.
      Still, utterly fascinating. As to the reconstruction, I am generally
      somewhat suspicious of all the reconstructive efforts, so common in the
      art world these days, especially when it comes to recreating art and
      exhibitions from the 1960s. Some of the art that’s being reconstructed was
      never meant to last. Exhibitions are, by definition, short- lived. I
      understand the pedagogical impulse and even identity with it. But
      sometimes the past should be allowed to stay in the past. Will we
      understand the studio better by rebuilding it and putting it inside an art
      museum?

    <InterviewQuestion>
      Magdalena, I wanted to turn to your essay on magnetic tape as an
      instrument. In it, you mention the first electroacoustic concert in
      Poland, which took place in 1960—an event that was part of the Warsaw
      Autumn Festival, which had notable overlaps with the Studio. It was the
      first occasion for playing Włodzimierz Kotoński’s Study for One Cymbal
      Stroke, one of the first and most famous compositions to come out of PRES.
      It’s a unique and notable concert, because, save for loudspeakers, the
      stage was virtually empty. What do you think liveness meant for PRES? And
      gathering?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      The fact that Kotoński’s Study even debuted at Warsaw Autumn Festival,
      with loudspeakers placed on the stage, shows commitment to the established
      ways of experiencing music—as well as the commitment to the shared aspect
      of musical experience, since Warsaw Autumn was a major international
      event. This concert took place at a high point of Polish modernism
      (nowoczesność), about five years after the political and cultural Thaw
      allowed any artistic experimentation on a larger scale after Stalinism.
      Nineteen sixty was a moment when people were still genuinely excited about
      the possibilities granted by new technologies; a time when such
      technologies were seen as a tool for emancipation. And so the elimination
      of live performers was not conceived as a threat to live music—such
      dystopian views only enter much later—but a welcome and necessary
      experimentation.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      I have a twofold question about PRES’s audience. You’ve both emphasized
      that during its time of operation PRES was a “hermetic place,” a “niche”
      that was principally of interest to musical experts, connoisseurs, and
      specialists. Composers and artists would come to PRES specifically to
      access this expertise—a notable example is Krzysztof Penderecki’s
      long-lasting collaboration with Eugeniusz Rudnik. This translated into a
      large share of their autonomous work not being familiar to a wider
      public—aside from the radio, most people didn’t have musical equipment at
      home and the Studio rarely shared musical scores. Rudnik cites special but
      poorly attended concerts in the basement of the National Philharmonic. But
      of course, its dual role as a musical and commercial entity meant that
      some of PRES’s work was widely heard—I am thinking specifically of its
      non-autonomous work for television and films. With this in mind, I am
      curious about the contemporary interest in the Studio. Would you say this
      is still a niche subject, pursued most actively by those with a pointed
      interest in early electronic music of the Eastern Bloc? And, thinking more
      specifically about the reception of your research, were you met with an
      equally specialist audience?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      You could probably call it a niche, though it is one that cuts through
      disciplines (music/art/new media) and attracts various audiences: from
      music amateurs on one end and scholars of Eastern Bloc on the other end of
      the spectrum. And some of the music that came out of the Studio—think
      Krzysztof Penderecki, for example—went right into the international
      mainstream of contemporary classical music. As it comes to the reception
      of this material in New York City, the people most enthusiastic were,
      indeed, scholars and amateurs of experimental and contemporary music, plus
      musicians and sound artists. But it's a pretty big crowd there that one
      can hardly qualify as a “niche.”
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      On the one hand, the pieces produced in the studio are still listened to
      by a rather closed circuit of people. On the other hand, the activity of
      different researchers and curators opened doors for an audience that was
      previously not aware of the existence of PRES or its role as a laboratory
      for audiovisual arts. The show I curated with Mendyk at ZKM in Karlsruhe
      [Through the Soundproof Curtain] and the accompanying publication [Ultra
      Sounds: The Sonic Art of Polish Radio Experimental Studio] expanded its
      recognition. Another element was the sample library mentioned previously
      and the commissions of new music using the Studio’s soundbank. This is
      expanding the audience of people that appreciate Rudnik, because Matmos
      referenced his work in their music.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewQuestion>
      To close, I wanted to turn to Bolesław Błaszczyk’s words, which
      read—“Rescued from near-oblivion, PRES is finally becoming recognized for
      its important contributions to European music and art. The galaxy proposed
      below, just like the celestial galaxies, is still extending. There are
      still more stars to discover.” Why do you think PRES stayed in the shadows
      for so long? And what do you think has to happen so that it never recedes
      back into them again?
    </InterviewQuestion>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="DM">
      The situation of other similar venues is not so different. The renaissance
      of interest in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop or GRM is fairly recent.
      Starting somewhere in the mid 2000s, revisiting the heritage of both of
      these was easier with more records and releases and less significant
      issues related to language barriers. Since then a lot of the work by Bôłt
      Records, Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź, or Adam Mickiewicz Institute has been
      invested in archiving, preserving, recontextualizing, and translating. At
      Muzeum Sztuki we are also collecting works that are connected with the
      Studio and putting them online, creating a new space for the variety of
      this production. It simply takes a bit longer for foreign researchers to
      get involved with this material.
    </InterviewAnswer>
    <InterviewAnswer subject="MM">
      I sympathize with Bolek Błaszyczyk’s sentiment. The truth is, though, that
      this rediscovery of PRES is very much in line with the more general
      interest in art of the period—the 1950s and 1960s—in recent art historical
      scholarship. And, more globally, with the interest in art practices that
      emerged in the former Eastern Europe under Communism. Even the basis for
      our collaboration, Daniel’s and mine, was a museum endeavor that speaks to
      that growing interest: a global research program at MoMA, called C-MAP,
      that the Museum started in 2010. And the amount of scholarship about PRES
      that has been produced in the past years in Poland and abroad assures the
      Studio’s history and cultural contributions are now universally
      recognized.
